# Agarivo

Agarivo is a clone of the game ["Agario"](http://agar.io/)
using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/)

## Installation
In order to host my Agario clone yourself, you have to install Node.js first.

**Ubuntu**

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
**MacOS**

```
$ brew install node
```
**Windows**

Download the Windows installer from the Node.js website and follow the instructions given by the installer.

## Usage
Then, run
```
$ cd path/to/folder
$ node server
```

Use mouse cursor or touch to control the movement of the cell

### Disclaimer:
This is knee-deep in development and is designed to purposefully run slow
as I am testing it on the same machine that I'm running the server on. This will
be changed in the future.
